# Titanic-Classification
Build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python. I developed a predictive model in Python to discern the likelihood of survival for Titanic passengers. Employing advanced techniques, the model unraveled insights into historical events, revealing influential factors such as age, class, and embarkation points. Through meticulous data preprocessing and algorithm experimentation, the project not only predicted survival rates but also provided nuanced perspectives on the impact of socio-economic factors. Beyond predictions, this venture underscored the potent intersection of data science and history, showcasing how technology enriches our understanding of significant events.
